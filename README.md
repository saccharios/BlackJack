Welcome!
There are two projects in this repo.
The first is "BlackJack" and the second "UnitTest_BlackJack".
The project "BlackJack" implements the game BlackJack. 
The game is playable via the standard console with keyboard user inputs.
Project "UnitTest_BlackJack" implements unit tests for "BlackJack". 
For these tests I use the googltest 1.7.0 framework. 
Its libraries and includes are stored in an external location.
You can run the test by executing the exe file in the Debug folder.
