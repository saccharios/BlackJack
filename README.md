Welcome!
There are two projects in this repo.
The first is the BlackJack game and the second UnitTest_BlackJack.
The game is playable via the standard console with keyboard user inputs.
There are two executeables, one in Release and the other in Debug folder.
For the unit tests I use the googltest 1.7.0 framework. 
Its libraries and includes are stored in an external location.
You can run the test by executing the exe file in the Debug folder.
